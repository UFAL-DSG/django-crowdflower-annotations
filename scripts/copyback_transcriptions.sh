usage="Usage: $0 <exported_dir> <target_dir>

Copies XML files containing transcribed audio from <exported_dir> to 
<target_dir>.  They will be detected as files named 'session.xml' and 
renamed to '$NEW_XML_NAME' in the process.  File overwriting is 
avoided.

If another name for the new logs is desired (the default being 
\"asr_transcribed.xml\"), export it in the environment variable 
NEW_XML_NAME, like this (in bash):

	NEW_XML_NAME=new_session_name.xml ./copyback_transcriptions.sh a b

or like this

	export NEW_XML_NAME=new_session_name.xml
	./copyback_transcriptions.sh a b

Similarly, OLD_XML_NAME can be set to a glob to match filenames of the log 
files from <exported_dir>. The default for OLD_XML_NAME is '*.xml'.

This script relies on the \`rename' implementation that uses Perl regexes."
