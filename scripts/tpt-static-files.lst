# This file lists templates for static files (including Django templates).
# Each line of the file should be
# 	a) a comment, starting with a hash ('#')
#   b) in the form <path-to-template>\t<path-to-instantiation>
# All lines not conforming to (b) will be ignored. Relative paths are 
# interpreted with respect to the (absolutized path to) the directory where 
# this list resides.
#
# Templates will get instantiated using the Django templating mechanism, 
# getting the settings module as an additional context in the 'settings' 
# key.
