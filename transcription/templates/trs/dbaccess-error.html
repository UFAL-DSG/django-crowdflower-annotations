<h1>Database error</h1>

<p>
Sorry, our database was unable to store your transcription. This is most 
likely because of too many transcribers trying to access the database at 
the same time. The admins have been sent an email and know that this 
happened.
</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>
Don't worry, your transcription is still remembered by your browser. Try 
refreshing this page now or in a few seconds, confirming you want to resend 
your data.
