			<h3>Ortography</h3>
			<p>
			Please, try to avoid spelling errors. Punctuation and capitalisation 
			generally do not matter, but please do <em>not</em> capitalise 
			sentence-initial letters (unless they belong to an acronym, see the 
			next sentence).  The exception is with acronyms &ndash; please 
			transcribe acronyms in uppercase letters.
