<h2>The code</h2>
<p>
Your code is: <strong style="font-size: 250%;">{{ code }}</strong>
</p>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>
<strong style="color: red; font-size: larger;">IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> We 
know what the transcriptions should look like for several dialogues. If 
your transcriptions do not match what we expected, the code above contains 
this information. We use this mechanism to ensure the quality of 
transcriptions you, transcribers, create.
</p>

<p>
<strong>However,</strong> you don't need to be worried if you were earnest 
when transcribing. We check only those utterances that are easy to 
understand, and we include some tolerance in matching your transcriptions 
to ours (disregarding letter case and punctuation, in the first place). In 
the improbable event that your transcription was right and not accepted, we 
will find about it and adjust the &ldquo;correct transcription&rdquo;.
